# Legal-Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-BERT-Base-Cased
This project fine-tunes a BERT Base Cased model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on legal text. It identifies and labels entities such as PERSON, ORG, DATE, and PROVISION in legal documents using the Hugging Face Transformers library and Gradio for an interactive web UI.
