# Legal-Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-BERT-Base-Cased
This project fine-tunes a BERT Base Cased model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on legal text. It identifies and labels entities such as PERSON, ORG, DATE, and PROVISION in legal documents using the Hugging Face Transformers library and Gradio for an interactive web UI. 

Label Entities:
PERSON â€“ Names of individuals mentioned in legal documents (e.g., parties, judges, witnesses).
ORG â€“ Names of organizations, companies, government bodies, or institutions involved in the case.
DATE â€“ Specific dates relevant to the legal matter (e.g., filing date, hearing date, contract date).
PROVISION â€“ Names or references to legal statutes, acts, codes, or regulations.
